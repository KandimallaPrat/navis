This package is a generalization of `Pymaid <https://github.com/schlegelp/PyMaid>`_
and is currently being refactored - I recommend watching the
`Github repository <https://github.com/schlegelp/navis>`_ for updates.
Make sure that your ``navis.__version__`` is up-to-date and check out the
:ref:`release notes <whats_new>`.

For a brief introduction to the library, please read the
:ref:`tutorial <tutorial>`. Visit the
:ref:`installation page <installing>` page to see how to download the
package. You can browse the :ref:`example gallery <example_gallery>` and
:ref:`API reference <api>` to see what you can do with navis.

NAVis is licensed under the GNU GPL v3+ license. The source code is hosted
at `Github <https://github.com/schlegelp/navis>`_. Feedback, feature requests
and bug reports are very welcome and best placed in
`issues <https://github.com/schlegelp/navis/issues>`_.
If you have any questions, please contact me: pms70@cam.ac.uk
